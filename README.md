## Acknowledgments

The JS needed some eventListeners but I wasn't sure how to code this exactly but I found a tutorial from TsbSankara on Youtube that explained it well. The JS is minimal and also easy for me to understand. I also took from this tutorial, the "hidden" class for the Thank-you card. I'm looking forward to building more projects and becoming more confident using JS on my own.
